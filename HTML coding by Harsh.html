<title>MY FIRST WEB PAGE</title>
<body "bgcolor=blue">Hello world!<br>This is my first ever webpage I am to create.So I am here to just have a knowledge about HTML coding.
So HTML, it is a language  used for designing web pages with the help of applications like the notepad or the wordpad etc.It is a markup language {as its name suggests <u>Hyper Text Markup Language</u>} so there are tags used in the text or code which is to be written on platform{i.e. notepad,wordpad,M.S. Wordetc}.
There are also many attributes which are used to define specific functions according to the need of the user.A simple webpage can be seen below:<br>
< H T M L ><br>
< H E A D >The text which you want to be written on head section< /H E A D ><br>
< T I T L E >The text which would be your title< /T I T L E>\ ><br>
< B O D Y >Everything rest would be written in this tag as it is the main part of the <b><i><u>HTML coding</b></i></u> < /B O D Y ><br>
< /H T M L ><br>
*In the above example of the simple coding I have used spaces among the letters in the tags so they are to display here and not used as tags and the tags are also non case sensitive, means it can be written in the smalll or capital letters whichever you want....
